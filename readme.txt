With StellarPay, you can offer recurring payments on any simple product, turning them into subscription products for your WooCommerce store:

* Set daily, weekly, monthly, or custom payment intervals (e.g., every 9 days or every 2 months).
* Choose indefinite or fixed-length billing cycles.
* Let customers manage their subscriptions via their WooCommerce My Account page.
* Handle everything, subscriptions, renewals, cancellations, from your WordPress dashboard.

**✔️ Installments**

Let customers split payments into smaller, more manageable amounts using Klarna, Affirm, or Afterpay/Clearpay. These options appear automatically for eligible products and regions, and require no special setup.

**✔️ Refunds, disputes, and payouts**

* Issue refunds directly from WooCommerce.
* Monitor and resolve disputes without needing to log into Stripe.
* Track upcoming and completed payouts from your StellarPay dashboard. No tab switching or external logins required.

**✔️ Failed payment insights**

When a payment fails, StellarPay tells you why, so there’s no need to sift through Stripe logs. You’ll get alerts and see clear error messages so you can take action quickly and maintain customer trust.

**✔️ [Custom checkout experience](https://stellarwp.com/docs/stellarpay/stellarpay-settings/appearance/?utm_source=stellarpay&utm_medium=wp.org&utm_campaign=readme)**

* Transactions use Stripe’s PCI-certified Stripe.js and Payment Element.
* You stay GDPR-compliant by default.

**✔️ Optional fee recovery**

Want to offset Stripe’s processing fees? You can enable optional fee recovery during setup. This adds a transparent fee at your Stripe checkout, helping you maintain your margins.
