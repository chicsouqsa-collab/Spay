### UI Text Guidelines

#### Use of Sentence Case

To ensure consistency and readability across the user interface (UI), all text elements within the plugin's UI should
follow **Sentence case**.

**What is Sentence case?**

Sentence case is a style of writing where only the first letter of the first word in a sentence is capitalized, along
with any proper nouns. This approach is generally used to make text more readable and approachable. Here's an example:

-   **Sentence case**: "This is an example of sentence case."
-   **Title Case**: "This Is an Example of Title Case."

**Why use Sentence case?**

-   **Readability**: Sentence case is easier to read, especially for longer sentences or descriptive text.
-   **Consistency**: Maintaining Sentence case throughout the UI creates a uniform and professional appearance.
-   **User-Friendly**: This style aligns with most modern UI/UX best practices, enhancing the overall user experience.

When adding or editing any UI text, please ensure that Sentence case is applied consistently across all elements.

### Release Process

#### Asset/Readme Updates

Updates to readme.txt and assets (.wordpress-org directory) are deployed via GitHub Actions:

-   Trigger: Manual workflow dispatch from main branch
-   Updates WordPress.org assets without modifying plugin files
-   Run workflow after pushing changes to readme.txt or screenshots

#### Plugin Releases

Full plugin deployments happen automatically when:

-   A new GitHub release is published
-   The workflow generates a ZIP, deploys to WordPress.org, and attaches the ZIP to the release

Required repository secrets:

-   `SVN_USERNAME`: WordPress.org SVN username
-   `SVN_PASSWORD`: WordPress.org SVN password
